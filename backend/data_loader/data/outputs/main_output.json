One candidate mechanism to establish communication in the brain is transient synchronization of oscillatory neural signals. Although there is abundant evidence for the involvement of cortical oscillations in brain functions based on the analysis of local power, assessment of the phase dynamics among spatially distributed neuronal populations and their relevance for behavior is still sparse. In the present study, we investigated the interaction between remote brain areas by analyzing high-density electroencephalogram (EEG) data obtained from human participants engaged in a visuotactile pattern matching task. We deployed an approach for purely data-driven clustering of neuronal phase coupling in source space, which allowed imaging of large-scale functional networks in space, time and frequency without defining a priori constraints. Based on the phase coupling results, we further explored how brain areas interacted across frequencies by computing phase-amplitude coupling. Several networks of interacting sources were identified with our approach, synchronizing their activity within and across the theta (~5 Hz), alpha (~10 Hz), and beta (~ 20 Hz) frequency bands and involving multiple brain areas that have previously been associated with attention and motor control. We demonstrate the functional relevance of these networks by showing that phase delays - in contrast to spectral power - were predictive of task performance.

By using only a small\nnumber of synthetic images created by NeuroGen, we demonstrate that we can\ndetect and amplify differences in regional and individual human brain response\npatterns to visual stimuli.

Therefore, the objective of our study was to validate the Arabic version of the Muscle Dysmorphic Disorder Inventory (Ar-MDDI), in order to make it accessible for Arabic-speaking populations.\n\n\nMETHODS\nUsing a snowball sampling technique, men university students (n\u2009=\u2009396) from multiple universities in Lebanon filled the survey in this cross-sectional designed study (January-May 2022). A soft copy of the questionnaire was created using google forms software, and sent to participants through the different social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. We used the Muscle Dysmorphic Disorder Inventory to assess Muscle Dysmorphia, along with the Big Three Perfectionism Scale to assess perfectionism and Eating Attitude Test (EAT) to evaluate the inappropriate eating attitudes. To explore the factor structure of Ar-MDDI, we computed a principal-axis Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) with the first split-half subsample using the FACTOR software. We used data from the second split-half to conduct a Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) using the SPSS AMOS v.29 software. Pearson correlation test was used to test the convergent and divergent validity of the Ar-MDDI scale with the other scores included in the study.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe results of the EFA revealed three factors, which explained 57.68% of the common variance: Factor 1\u2009=\u2009Appearance intolerance, Factor 2\u2009=\u2009Drive for size, and Factor 3\u2009=\u2009Functional impairment. The CFA fit indices of the three-factor model of the Ar-MDDI scale showed good results. Moreover, 254 (64.1%) of the participants had inappropriate eating attitudes (EAT scores\u2009\u2265\u200920). Indices suggested that configural, metric, and scalar invariance was supported according to eating attitudes. No significant difference between participants with appropriate versus inappropriate eating attitudes in terms of functional impairment, drive for size and appearance intolerance. Perfectionism scores correlated positively with the Ar-MDDI, which suggests divergent validity.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOur findings revealed that the validation of the Arabic scale yielded excellent properties, preliminarily supporting its use for the assessment of muscle dysmorphia among Arabic-speaking university men. This would hopefully allow for its timely detection and management in Arab clinical settings and encourage cross-cultural research on this topic.", "pmid": "36703234", "source": "medline"}, {"title": "Nomogram based on spectral CT quantitative parameters and typical radiological features for distinguishing benign from malignant thyroid micro-nodules.", "authors": [{"lastname": "Song", "forename": "Zuhua", "initials": "Z", "identifier": "", "affiliation": ["Department of Radiology, Chongqing General Hospital, No.118, Xingguang Avenue, Liangjiang New Area, Chongqing, 401147, China."]}, {"lastname": "Li", "forename": "Qian", "initials": "Q", "identifier": "", "affiliation": ["Department of Radiology, Chongqing General Hospital, No.118, Xingguang Avenue, Liangjiang New Area, Chongqing, 401147, China."]}, {"lastname": "Zhang", "forename": "Dan", "initials": "D", "identifier": "", "affiliation": ["Department of Radiology, Chongqing General Hospital, No.118, Xingguang Avenue, Liangjiang New Area, Chongqing, 401147, China."]}, {"lastname": "Li", "forename": "Xiaojiao", "initials": "X", "identifier": "", "affiliation": ["Department of Radiology, Chongqing General Hospital, No.118, Xingguang Avenue, Liangjiang New Area, Chongqing, 401147, China."]}, {"lastname": "Yu", "forename": "Jiayi", "initials": "J", "identifier": "", "affiliation": ["Department of Radiology, Chongqing General Hospital, No.118, Xingguang Avenue, Liangjiang New Area, Chongqing, 401147, China."]}, {"lastname": "Liu", "forename": "Qian", "initials": "Q", "identifier": "", "affiliation": ["Department of Radiology, Chongqing General Hospital, No.118, Xingguang Avenue, Liangjiang New Area, Chongqing, 401147, China."]}, {"lastname": "Li", "forename": "Zongwen", "initials": "Z", "identifier": "", "affiliation": ["Department of Radiology, Chongqing General Hospital, No.118, Xingguang Avenue, Liangjiang New Area, Chongqing, 401147, China."]}, {"lastname": "Huang", "forename": "Jie", "initials": "J", "identifier": "", "affiliation": ["Department of Radiology, Chongqing General Hospital, No.118, Xingguang Avenue, Liangjiang New Area, Chongqing, 401147, China."]}, {"lastname": "Zhang", "forename": "Xiaodi", "initials": "X", "identifier": "", "affiliation": ["Philips Healthcare, Chengdu branch, Chengdu, China."]}, {"lastname": "Tang", "forename": "Zhuoyue", "initials": "Z", "identifier": "", "affiliation": ["Department of Radiology, Chongqing General Hospital, No.118, Xingguang Avenue, Liangjiang New Area, Chongqing, 401147, China. zhuoyue_tang@cqmu.edu.cn."]}], "abstract": "PURPOSE\nTo analyse the predictive effect of a nomogram combining dual-layer spectral computed tomography (DSCT) quantitative parameters with typical radiological features in distinguishing benign micro-nodule from thyroid microcarcinoma (TMC).\n\n\nMETHODS\nData from 342 instances with thyroid micro-nodules (\u22641\u2009cm) who underwent DSCT (benign group: n\u2009=\u2009170; malignant group: n\u2009=\u2009172) were reviewed. Typical radiological features including micro-calcification and enhanced blurring, and DSCT quantitative parameters including attenuation on virtual monoenergetic images (40\u2009keV, 70\u2009keV and 100\u2009keV), the slope of the spectral HU curve (\u03bbHU), normalized iodine concentration (NIC), and normalized effective atomic number (NZeff) in the arterial phase (AP) and venous phase (VP), were measured and compared between the benign and malignant groups. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to assess the diagnostic performance of significant quantitative DSCT parameters or the models combining DSCT parameters respectively and typical radiological features based on multivariate logistic regression (LR) analysis. A nomogram was developed using predictors with the highest diagnostic performance in the above model, as determined by multivariate LR analysis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe DSCT parameter\u00a0AP\u03bbHU showed the greatest diagnostic efficiency in identifying patients with TMC, with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.829, a sensitivity and specificity of 0.738 and 0.753, respectively. Then, AP\u03bbHU was combined with the two radiological features to construct the DSCT-Radiological nomogram, which had an AUC of 0.858, a sensitivity of 0.791 and a specificity of 0.800. The calibration curve of the nomogram demonstrated that the prediction result was in good agreement with the actual observation. The decision curve revealed that the nomogram can result in a greater net benefit than the all/none-intervention strategy for all threshold probabilities.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAs a valid and visual noninvasive prediction tool, the DSCT-Radiological nomogram incorporating DSCT quantitative parameters and radiological features shows favourable predictive efficiency for identifying benign and malignant thyroid micro-nodules.", "pmid": "36703218", "source": "medline"}, {"title": "Aggregation tests identify new gene associations with breast cancer in populations with diverse ancestry.", "authors": [{"lastname": "Mueller", "forename": "Stefanie H", "initials": "SH", "identifier": "", "affiliation": ["Institute of Health Informatics, University College London, London, UK."]}, {"lastname": "Lai", "forename": "Alvina G", "initials": "AG", "identifier": "", "affiliation": ["Institute of Health Informatics, University College London, London, UK."]}, {"lastname": "Valkovskaya", "forename": "Maria", "initials": "M", "identifier": "", "affiliation": ["Division of Psychiatry, University College London, London, UK."]}, {"lastname": "Michailidou", "forename": "Kyriaki", "initials": "K", "identifier": "", "affiliation": ["Biostatistics Unit, The Cyprus Institute of Neurology and Genetics, 2371, Nicosia, Cyprus.", "Cyprus School of Molecular Medicine, The Cyprus Institute of Neurology and Genetics, 2371, Nicosia, Cyprus.", "Centre for Cancer Genetic Epidemiology, Department of Public Health and Primary Care, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, CB1 8RN, UK."]}, {"lastname": "Bolla", "forename": "Manjeet K", "initials": "MK", "identifier": "", "affiliation": ["Centre for Cancer Genetic Epidemiology, Department of Public Health and Primary Care, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, CB1 8RN, UK."]}, {"lastname": "Wang", "forename": "Qin", "initials": "Q", "identifier": "", "affiliation": ["Centre for Cancer Genetic Epidemiology, Department of Public Health and Primary Care, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, CB1 8RN, UK."]}, {"lastname": "Dennis", "forename": "Joe", "initials": "J", "identifier": "", "affiliation": ["Centre for Cancer Genetic Epidemiology, Department of Public Health and Primary Care, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, CB1 8RN, UK."]}, {"lastname": "Lush", "forename": "Michael", "initials": "M", "identifier": "", "affiliation": ["Centre for Cancer Genetic Epidemiology, Department of Public Health and Primary Care, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, CB1 8RN, UK."]}, {"lastname": "Abu-Ful", "forename": "Zomoruda", "initials": "Z", "identifier": "", "affiliation": ["Clalit National Cancer Control Center, Carmel Medical Center and Technion Faculty of Medicine, 35254, Haifa, Israel."]}, {"lastname": "Ahearn", "forename": "Thomas U", "initials": "TU", "identifier": "", "affiliation": ["Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, Department of Health and Human Services, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, 20850, USA."]}, {"lastname": "Andrulis", "forename": "Irene L", "initials": "IL", "identifier": "", "affiliation": ["Fred A.

breast cancer (BC) susceptibility. Gene-based methods can increase power by combining multiple variants in the same gene and help identify target genes.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe evaluated the potential of gene-based aggregation in the Breast Cancer Association Consortium cohorts including 83,471 cases and 59,199 controls. Low-frequency variants were aggregated for individual genes' coding and regulatory regions. Association results in European ancestry samples were compared to single-marker association results in the same cohort. Gene-based associations were also combined in meta-analysis across individuals with European, Asian, African, and Latin American and Hispanic ancestry.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn European ancestry samples, 14 genes were significantly associated (q\u2009<\u20090.05) with BC. Of those, two genes, FMNL3 (P\u2009=\u20096.11\u2009\u00d7\u200910-6) and AC058822.1 (P\u2009=\u20091.47\u2009\u00d7\u200910-4), represent new associations. High FMNL3 expression has previously been linked to poor prognosis in several other cancers. Meta-analysis of samples with diverse ancestry discovered further associations including established candidate genes ESR1 and CBLB. Furthermore, literature review and database query found further support for a biologically plausible link with cancer for genes CBLB, FMNL3, FGFR2, LSP1, MAP3K1, and SRGAP2C.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nUsing extended gene-based aggregation tests including coding and regulatory variation, we report identification of plausible target genes for previously identified single-marker associations with BC as well as the discovery of novel genes implicated in BC development. Including multi ancestral cohorts in this study enabled the identification of otherwise missed disease associations as ESR1 (P\u2009=\u20091.31\u2009\u00d7\u200910-5), demonstrating the importance of diversifying study cohorts.", "pmid": "36703164", "source": "medline"}, {"title": "Is it time to re-think FAST?

Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis compares the performance of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) to conventional ultrasound when used as the initial assessment for abdominal trauma prior to computed tomography (CT) imaging.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA systematic literature search of major databases was conducted of human studies investigating the diagnostic accuracy of conventional ultrasound and CEUS occurring prior to CT imaging for abdominal trauma. The study followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement. The quality of studies was evaluated using the QUADAS-2 (Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2) tool. Paired pooled sensitivity and specificity between conventional ultrasound and CEUS were compared using data extracted from the eligible studies. Diagnostic odds ratio, number needed to diagnose values, and likelihood ratios were also determined.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTen studies were included. More than half of the included studies demonstrated low risk of bias. Using McNemar's test to assess for paired binary observations, we found that CEUS had statistically higher sensitivity (0.933 vs. 0.559; two-tailed, P\u2009<\u20090.001) and specificity (0.995 vs. 0.979; two-tailed, P\u2009<\u20090.001) than conventional ultrasound in the setting of abdominal trauma, respectively. When divided into particular findings of clinical interest, CEUS had statistically higher sensitivity than conventional ultrasound in screening for active bleeding and injuries to all abdominal solid organs. CEUS also had superior diagnostic odds ratios, number needed to diagnose values, and likelihood ratios than conventional ultrasound.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe diagnostic value of CEUS was higher than that of conventional ultrasound for differentiating traumatic abdominal injuries when used as the initial assessment in the emergency department.", "pmid": "36703099", "source": "medline"}, {"title": "Fully automated accurate patient positioning in computed tomography using anterior-posterior localizer images and a deep neural network: a dual-center study.", "authors": [{"lastname": "Salimi", "forename": "Yazdan", "initials": "Y", "identifier": "", "affiliation": ["Division of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, Geneva University Hospital, CH-1211, Geneva, Switzerland."]}, {"lastname": "Shiri", "forename": "Isaac", "initials": "I", "identifier": "", "affiliation": ["Division of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, Geneva University Hospital, CH-1211, Geneva, Switzerland."]}, {"lastname": "Akavanallaf", "forename": "Azadeh", "initials": "A", "identifier": "", "affiliation": ["Division of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, Geneva University Hospital, CH-1211, Geneva, Switzerland."]}, {"lastname": "Mansouri", "forename": "Zahra", "initials": "Z", "identifier": "", "affiliation": ["Division of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, Geneva University Hospital, CH-1211, Geneva, Switzerland."]}, {"lastname": "Arabi", "forename": "Hossein", "initials": "H", "identifier": "", "affiliation": ["Division of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, Geneva University Hospital, CH-1211, Geneva, Switzerland."]}, {"lastname": "Zaidi", "forename": "Habib", "initials": "H", "identifier": "0000-0001-7559-5297", "affiliation": ["Division of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, Geneva University Hospital, CH-1211, Geneva, Switzerland. habib.zaidi@hcuge.ch.", "Geneva University Neurocenter, Geneva University, Geneva, Switzerland. habib.zaidi@hcuge.ch.", "Department of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands. habib.zaidi@hcuge.ch.", "Department of Nuclear Medicine, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark. habib.zaidi@hcuge.ch."]}], "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nThis study aimed to improve patient positioning accuracy by relying on a CT localizer and a deep neural network to optimize image quality and radiation dose.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe included 5754 chest CT axial and anterior-posterior (AP) images from two different centers, C1 and C2. After pre-processing, images were split into training (80%) and test (20%) datasets. A deep neural network was trained to generate 3D axial images from the AP localizer. The geometric centerlines of patient bodies were indicated by creating a bounding box on the predicted images. The distance between the body centerline, estimated by the deep learning model and ground truth (BCAP), was compared with patient mis-centering during manual positioning (BCMP). We evaluated the performance of our model in terms of distance between the lung centerline estimated by the deep learning model and the ground truth (LCAP).\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe error in terms of BCAP was - 0.75 \u00b1 7.73 mm and 2.06 \u00b1 10.61 mm for C1 and C2, respectively. This error was significantly lower than BCMP, which achieved an error of 9.35 \u00b1 14.94 and 13.98 \u00b1 14.5 mm for C1 and C2, respectively. The absolute BCAP was 5.7 \u00b1 5.26 and 8.26 \u00b1 6.96 mm for C1 and C2, respectively. The LCAP metric was 1.56 \u00b1 10.8 and -0.27 \u00b1 16.29 mm for C1 and C2, respectively. The error in terms of BCAP and LCAP was higher for larger patients (p value\u2009<\u20090.01).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe accuracy of the proposed method was comparable to available alternative methods, carrying the advantage of being free from errors related to objects blocking the camera visibility.\n\n\nKEY POINTS\n\u2022\u00a0Patient mis-centering in the anterior-posterior direction (AP) is a common problem in clinical practice which can degrade image quality and increase patient radiation dose. \u2022\u00a0We proposed a deep neural network for automatic patient positioning using only the CT image localizer, achieving a performance comparable to alternative techniques, such as the external 3D visual camera. \u2022\u00a0The advantage of the proposed method is that it is free from errors related to objects blocking the camera visibility and that it could be implemented on imaging consoles as a patient positioning support tool.", "pmid": "36703015", "source": "medline"}, {"title":

To overcome this limitation, we aggregated genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics, whole-genome sequences and expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) data from diverse ancestries. We developed a new approach, TESLA (multi-ancestry integrative study using an optimal linear combination of association statistics), to integrate an eQTL dataset with a multi-ancestry GWAS. By exploiting shared phenotypic effects between ancestries and accommodating potential effect heterogeneities, TESLA improves power over other TWAS methods. When applied to tobacco use phenotypes, TESLA identified 273 new genes, up to 55% more compared with alternative TWAS methods. These hits and subsequent fine mapping using TESLA point to target genes with biological relevance. In silico drug-repurposing analyses highlight several drugs with known efficacy, including dextromethorphan and galantamine, and new drugs such as muscle relaxants that may be repurposed for treating nicotine addiction.", "pmid": "36702996", "source": "medline"}, {"title": "Extracting probability in the absence of visual awareness.", "authors": [{"lastname": "Hung", "forename": "Shao-Min", "initials": "SM", "identifier": "", "affiliation": ["Faculty of Science and Engineering, Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan. smhung@aoni.waseda.jp.", "Biology and Biological Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA. smhung@aoni.waseda.jp."]}, {"lastname": "Wu", "forename": "Daw-An", "initials": "DA", "identifier": "", "affiliation": ["Biology and Biological Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA."]}, {"lastname": "Escobar", "forename": "Leslie", "initials": "L", "identifier": "", "affiliation": ["Biology and Biological Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA."]}, {"lastname": "Hsieh", "forename": "Po-Jang", "initials": "PJ", "identifier": "", "affiliation": ["Department of Psychology, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan."]}, {"lastname": "Shimojo", "forename": "Shinsuke", "initials": "S", "identifier": "", "affiliation": ["Biology and Biological Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA.", "Computation and Neural Systems, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA."]}], "abstract": "Extracting statistical regularities from the environment is crucial for survival. It allows us to learn cues for where and when future events will occur. Can we learn these associations even when the cues are not consciously perceived? Can these unconscious processes integrate information over long periods of time? We show that human visual system can track the probability of location contingency between an unconscious prime and a conscious target over a period of time of minutes. In a series of psychophysical experiments, we adopted an exogenous priming paradigm and manipulated the location contingency between a masked prime and a visible target (i.e., how likely the prime location predicted the target location). The prime's invisibility was verified both subjectively and objectively. Although the participants were unaware of both the existence of the prime and the prime-target contingency, our results showed that the probability of location contingency was tracked and manifested in the subsequent priming effect. When participants were first entrained into the fully predictive prime-target probability, they exhibited faster responses to the more predictive location. On the contrary, when no contingency existed between the prime and target initially, participants later showed faster responses to the less predictive location. These results were replicated in two more experiments with increased statistical power and a fine-grained delineation of prime awareness. Together, we report that the human visual system is capable of tracking unconscious probability over a period of time, demonstrating how implicit and uncertain regularity guides behavior.", "pmid": "36702992", "source": "medline"}, {"title": "RbQE: An Efficient Method for Content-Based Medical Image Retrieval Based on Query Expansion.", "authors": [{"lastname": "Rashad", "forename": "Metwally", "initials": "M", "identifier": "0000-0003-4946-3682", "affiliation": ["Department of Computer Science, Faculty of Computers & Artificial Intelligence, Benha University, Benha, Egypt. metwally.rashad@fci.bu.edu.eg.", "Faculty of Artificial Intelligence, Delta University for Science and Technology, Gamasa, Egypt. metwally.rashad@fci.bu.edu.eg."]}, {"lastname": "Afifi", "forename": "Ibrahem", "initials": "I", "identifier": "", "affiliation": ["Department of Information System, Faculty of Computers & Artificial Intelligence, Benha University, Benha, Egypt."]}, {"lastname": "Abdelfatah", "forename": "Mohammed", "initials": "M", "identifier": "", "affiliation": ["Department of Information System, Faculty of Computers & Artificial Intelligence, Benha University, Benha, Egypt."]}], "abstract": "Systems for retrieving and managing content-based medical images are becoming more important, especially as medical imaging technology advances and the medical image database grows. In addition, these systems can also use medical images to better grasp and gain a deeper understanding of the causes and treatments of different diseases, not just for diagnostic purposes. For achieving all these purposes, there is a critical need for an efficient and accurate content-based medical image retrieval (CBMIR) method. This paper proposes an efficient method (RbQE) for the retrieval of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) images. RbQE is based on expanding the features of querying and exploiting the pre-trained learning models AlexNet and VGG-19 to extract compact, deep, and high-level features from medical images. There are two searching procedures in RbQE: a rapid search and a final search. In the rapid search, the original query is expanded by retrieving the top-ranked images from each class and is used to reformulate the query by calculating the mean values for deep features of the top-ranked images, resulting in a new query for each class. In the final search, the new query that is most similar to the original query will be used for retrieval from the database. The performance of the proposed method has been compared to state-of-the-art methods on four publicly available standard databases, namely, TCIA-CT, EXACT09-CT, NEMA-CT, and OASIS-MRI. Experimental results show that the proposed method exceeds the compared methods by 0.84%, 4.86%, 1.24%, and 14.34% in average retrieval precision (ARP) for the TCIA-CT, EXACT09-CT, NEMA-CT, and OASIS-MRI databases, respectively.", "pmid": "36702987", "source": "medline"}, {"title": "Increased levels of nerve growth factor accompany oxidative load in recurrent pregnancy loss.

A total of 120 participants, RPL disease (n\u2009=\u200960) and healthy individuals (n\u2009=\u200960), participated in the study. First, we investigated the effect of circulating nerve growth factor (NGF) in RPL and healthy groups. To show NGF's effect, we measured the level of oxidative loads such as Total Antioxidant Level (TAS), Total Oxidant Level (TOS), and Oxidative Stress Index (OSI) with Beckman Coulter AU system and biochemical assays. We find a correlation between oxidative load and NGF level. Oxidative load mainly causes structural changes in the blood. Therefore, we obtained Raman measurements of the participant's serum. Then we selected two Raman regions, 800 and 1800\u00a0cm-1, and between 2700\u00a0cm-1 and 3000\u00a0cm-1, to see chemical changes. We noted that Raman spectra obtained for RPL and healthy women differed. The findings confirm that the imbalance between reactive oxygen species and antioxidants has important implications for the pathogenesis of RPL and that NGF levels accompany the level of oxidative load in the RPL state. Biomolecular structure and composition were determined using Raman spectroscopy and machine learning methods, and the correlation of these parameters was studied alongside machine learning technologies to advance toward clinical translation. Here we determined and validated the development of instrumentation for the Analysis of RPL patients' serum that can differentiate from control individuals with an accuracy of 100% using the Raman region corresponding to structural changes. Furthermore, this study found a correlation between traditional biochemical parameters and Raman data. This suggests that Raman spectroscopy is a sensitive tool for detecting biochemical changes in serum caused by RPL or other diseases.", "pmid": "36702951", "source": "medline"}, {"title": "Early

Here, we present a mobile health (mHealth) system, the smartphone-based Apollo Infant Sight (AIS), which identifies visually impaired children with any of 16 ophthalmic disorders by recording and analyzing their gazing behaviors and facial features under visual stimuli. Videos from 3,652 children (\u226448 months in age; 54.5% boys) were prospectively collected to develop and validate this system. For detecting visual impairment, AIS achieved an area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.940 in an internal validation set and an AUC of 0.843 in an external validation set collected in multiple ophthalmology clinics across China. In a further test of AIS for at-home implementation by untrained parents or caregivers using their smartphones, the system was able to adapt to different testing conditions and achieved an AUC of 0.859.
