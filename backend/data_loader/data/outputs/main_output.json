One candidate mechanism to establish communication in the brain is transient synchronization of oscillatory neural signals. Although there is abundant evidence for the involvement of cortical oscillations in brain functions based on the analysis of local power, assessment of the phase dynamics among spatially distributed neuronal populations and their relevance for behavior is still sparse. In the present study, we investigated the interaction between remote brain areas by analyzing high-density electroencephalogram (EEG) data obtained from human participants engaged in a visuotactile pattern matching task. We deployed an approach for purely data-driven clustering of neuronal phase coupling in source space, which allowed imaging of large-scale functional networks in space, time and frequency without defining a priori constraints. Based on the phase coupling results, we further explored how brain areas interacted across frequencies by computing phase-amplitude coupling. Several networks of interacting sources were identified with our approach, synchronizing their activity within and across the theta (~5 Hz), alpha (~10 Hz), and beta (~ 20 Hz) frequency bands and involving multiple brain areas that have previously been associated with attention and motor control. We demonstrate the functional relevance of these networks by showing that phase delays - in contrast to spectral power - were predictive of task performance.

CHD8 suppression led to significant reduction (47.82%) in histone H3K36me3 peaks at gene bodies, particularly impacting on transcriptional elongation chromatin states. H3K36me3 reduction specifically affects highly expressed, CHD8-bound genes and correlates with altered alternative splicing patterns of 462 genes implicated in 'regulation of RNA splicing' and 'mRNA catabolic process'. Mass spectrometry analysis uncovered a novel interaction between CHD8 and the splicing regulator heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L (hnRNPL), providing the first mechanistic insights to explain the CHD8 suppression-derived splicing phenotype, partly implicating SETD2, a H3K36me3 methyltransferase. In summary, our results point toward broad molecular consequences of CHD8 suppression, entailing altered histone deposition/maintenance and RNA processing regulation as important regulatory processes in ASD.", "pmid": "36537238", "source": "medline"}, {"title": "Verification of patient-setup accuracy using a surface imaging system with steep measurement angle.", "authors": [{"lastname": "Sasaki", "forename": "Fumihiro", "initials": "F", "identifier": "", "affiliation": ["Teine Keijinkai Hospital, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan."]}, {"lastname": "Yamashita", "forename": "Yuusuke", "initials": "Y", "identifier": "", "affiliation": ["Graduate School of Biomedical Science and Technology, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan."]}, {"lastname": "Nakano", "forename": "Satoshi", "initials": "S", "identifier": "", "affiliation": ["Teine Keijinkai Hospital, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan."]}, {"lastname": "Ishikawa", "forename": "Masayori", "initials": "M", "identifier": "", "affiliation": ["Faculty of Health Sciences, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan."]}], "abstract": "PURPOSE\nWe evaluate an SGRT device (Voxelan HEV-600\u00a0M/RMS) installed with Radixact, with the view angle of the Voxelan's camera at 74 degrees.

The patients were imaged with CT and MRI scans on the same day. The MRI protocol included a T2-weighted HASTE sequence (TR=1400 ms, TE=95 ms, slice thickness (ST)=3 mm), T2-weighted BLADE sequence (TR=5379 ms, TE=100 ms, ST=3 mm), and 3D VIBE sequence (TR=3.9 ms, TE=1.32 ms, ST=3 mm).

The study was conducted on different satellite imagery (Sentinel-2A, ASTER and the Landsat TM5, ETM+, and OLI) using SAGA GIS and SNAP software, to achieve two specific objectives: (1) conducting a comparative analysis of the NDVI calculation results from three satellite images (i.e., sentinel-2A, ASTER, Landsat 8); (2) highlighting the dynamics of the NDVI index from 1984 to 2020 by processing 35 satellite images from Landsat data Archive using SAGA GIS software, and then correlating these changes with other vegetation indices for the Marrakech-Haouz region provided by NOAA, namely: Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), Temperature Condition Index (TCI), and NDVI indices. This study shows a repetitive fluctuation in the decrease of NDVI mean value from 1984 to 2020, due to the contrasting climate setting of the study area and the influence of the alternation of humid and dry periods in the High Atlas of Marrakech. In addition, the presented results underline that open-source software, such as SAGA GIS and SNAP can provide satisfactory results for vegetation coverage dynamics.", "pmid": "36536903", "source": "medline"}, {"title": "Dynamics and Equilibration Mechanisms in Block Copolymer Particles.", "authors": [{"lastname": "Lodge", "forename": "Timothy P", "initials": "TP", "identifier": "0000-0001-5916-8834", "affiliation": ["Department of Chemistry, University of Minnesota 207 Pleasant St SE, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, United States.", "Department of Chemical Engineering & Materials Science, University of Minnesota 451 Washington Ave SE, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, United States."]}, {"lastname": "Seitzinger", "forename": "Claire L", "initials": "CL", "identifier": "", "affiliation": ["Department of Chemistry, University of Minnesota 207 Pleasant St SE, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, United States."]}, {"lastname": "Seeger", "forename": "Sarah C", "initials": "SC", "identifier": "0000-0002-3224-7222", "affiliation": ["Department of Chemical Engineering & Materials Science, University of Minnesota 451 Washington Ave SE, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, United States."]}, {"lastname": "Yang", "forename": "Sanghee", "initials": "S", "identifier": "0000-0001-7944-6635", "affiliation": ["Department of Chemistry, University of Minnesota 207 Pleasant St SE, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, United States."]}, {"lastname": "Gupta", "forename": "Supriya", "initials": "S", "identifier": "", "affiliation": ["Department of Chemistry, University of Minnesota 207 Pleasant St SE, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, United States."]}, {"lastname": "Dorfman", "forename": "Kevin D", "initials": "KD", "identifier": "0000-0003-0065-5157", "affiliation": ["Department of Chemical Engineering & Materials Science, University of Minnesota 451 Washington Ave SE, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, United States."]}], "abstract": "Self-assembly of block copolymers into interesting and useful nanostructures, in both solution and bulk, is a vibrant research arena. While much attention has been paid to characterization and prediction of equilibrium phases, the associated dynamic processes are far from fully understood. Here, we explore what is known and not known about the equilibration of particle phases in the bulk, and spherical micelles in solution. The presumed primary equilibration mechanisms are chain exchange, fusion, and fragmentation. These processes have been extensively studied in surfactants and lipids, where they occur on subsecond time scales. In contrast, increased chain lengths in block copolymers create much larger barriers, and time scales can become prohibitively slow. In practice, equilibration of block copolymers is achievable only in proximity to the critical micelle temperature (in solution) or the order-disorder transition (in the bulk). Detailed theories for these processes in block copolymers are few. In the bulk, the rate of chain exchange can be quantified by tracer diffusion measurements. Often the rate of equilibration, in terms of number density and aggregation number of particles, is much slower than chain exchange, and consequently observed particle phases are often metastable. This is particularly true in regions of the phase diagram where Frank-Kasper phases occur. Chain exchange in solution has been explored quantitatively by time-resolved SANS, but the results are not well captured by theory. Computer simulations, particularly via dissipative particle dynamics, are beginning to shed light on the chain escape mechanism at the molecular level. The rate of fragmentation has been quantified in a few experimental systems, and TEM images support a mechanism akin to the anaphase stage of mitosis in cells, via a thin neck that pinches off to produce two smaller micelles. Direct measurements of micelle fusion are quite rare. Suggestions for future theoretical, computational, and experimental efforts are offered.", "pmid": "36536887", "source": "medline"}]
